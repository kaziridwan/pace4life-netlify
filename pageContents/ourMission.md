# We want to make a lasting impact in the health and well being of people in the developing world.

Our mission is to make a lasting impact in the health and well being of people in developing countries by reusing pacemakers which are currently thrown away in the UK as waste. To achieve this we aim to run a range of projects and services that fall broadly into five areas:

- Information
- Advocacy
- Procurement
- Awareness raising
- Research

The purpose of this project is to create a central organization that obtains pacemakers for evaluation and subsequent sterilization, creating a distribution network for safe reuse.

Recycling and more importantly “reuse” can give millions of people worldwide the opportunity to save lives in developing nations using a currently wasted resource: the tiny pacemakers that help regulate heartbeat.

Our goal to create a scalable model that can be replicated across the world for the benefit of developing nations and for those unable to afford pacemakers and the associated therapy.

> “The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is expected to increase 137 percent between 1990 and 2020 for those living in low- and middle- income countries, authors write. It's estimated that as many as 1 million people worldwide die annually from slow heart rates.”\_ - ScienceDaily (Oct. 9, 2009)​​

Additionally, firmly believing in the principle of patient-centered medicine we are committed to increasing the employment opportunities at Pace4Life for people with pacemakers and also encouraging them to become volunteers.
